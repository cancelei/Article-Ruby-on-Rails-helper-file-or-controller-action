# Helper File or Controller Method: Making Technical Decisions in Ruby on Rails

When developing a Ruby on Rails application, developers frequently face the decision of whether to place shared functionality in a helper file or within a controller method. Both approaches have their merits and specific use cases, and choosing the appropriate one can greatly impact the maintainability and clarity of your code.

# Understanding Helpers and Controllers

If you are an experienced coder, move to 'Edge Case Consideration' in the section below.

# Helper Files definition

Helpers in Rails are primarily used to extract complex logic out of the views, making the views cleaner and more readable. They are intended for methods that are directly related to the presentation layer.

# Controller Methods definition

Controllers in Rails handle the request lifecycle, interacting with models to fetch and persist data, and then rendering views or redirecting as necessary. Controller methods typically manage the business logic and the flow of data between the model and the view.

# Pros of Using Helpers:

- Formatting data for display (e.g., date and time formats).
- Creating reusable view components (e.g., form elements).
- Handling view-specific logic that does not pertain to the business domain.

# Pros of Using Controller Methods:

- Encapsulation of Business Logic: Controllers are ideal for encapsulating business logic that is specific to a request-response cycle.
- Maintainability: Keeping business logic in controllers can make it easier to manage and update as application requirements change.
- Data Processing =): Controllers are well-suited for handling data processing tasks before passing the data to views.

# Two Example Scenario

Consider a scenario where you need to display a formatted date in multiple views. This task is best handled by a helper method:

On the other hand, if you need to fetch and process user data before displaying it, a controller method is more appropriate (e.g: ETL Data entry point || tools Python/Spark):

# Edge Case Consideration

Experienced developers often encounter scenarios where functionality involves both presentation and business logic. Consider a feature where you need to display a list of users along with their roles and statuses, color-coded for easy identification. This task involves fetching data, processing it, and applying presentation-specific formatting.

In such a case, using a presenter or decorator pattern can provide a balanced solution:

In the controller, you would use this presenter and any view would consume the method:

For non-rubists: .html.erb file using ruby controller e.g. <%= user.status_color %> that is inside of a loop using .each, rendering all user status with the UserPresenter Class.

This approach encapsulates both the data fetching and presentation logic in a clean, reusable manner. The presenter pattern allows for more sophisticated formatting and processing without cluttering the views or controllers.
By considering such edge cases, developers can ensure their architecture decisions lead to robust, maintainable applications that handle complex scenarios elegantly.
